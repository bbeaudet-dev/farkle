# HANDOFF2: Next Agent Handoff

**First step: Double check the Extra Die consumable implementation before anything else.**

## Current State

- All core game logic, scoring, and partitioning is robust and tested.
- Charm system is fully implemented, modular, and extensible.
- Consumable system is fully implemented, modular, and supports in-game and between-rounds usage.
- All core consumables are selectable and most effects are implemented (see below for remaining work).
- CLI is user-friendly, supports 'use' command, and robust to invalid input.
- Codebase is modular: consumable effects are in `consumableEffects.ts`, game orchestration in `gameEngine.ts`.

## What Has Been Completed

- Phases 1â€“3: Game flow, scoring, partitioning, charm system, and advanced charm effects.
- Phase 5a/5b: Consumable framework and most core consumable effects (see below).
- Modular, extensible codebase ready for new features.

## What Remains (Phase 4a/4b: Dice Material Framework)

- Implement the dice material system framework.
- Add material tracking to dice state (already present in model, but effects not implemented).
- Implement material effect calculation system (e.g., Crystal, Wooden, Golden, Volcano, Mirror dice effects).
- Integration test: verify materials are tracked and effects calculated.

## Remaining Consumable Effects (for reference)

- Material Enchanter: Let player pick a die and change its material.
- Chisel: Downgrade a die of your choice to the next smaller size.
- Pottery Wheel: Upgrade a die of your choice to the next larger size.

## Important Notes & Design Decisions

- All selection menus (charms, consumables) are personalized and robust.
- All prompts that support consumables use the `WithConsumables` suffix for clarity.
- Charm slots are always based on the dice set, never hardcoded.
- Consumable effects are modular and easy to extend.
- Forfeit Recovery now works between rounds and only removes the consumable if it is actually used.
- CLI is robust to invalid input at all prompts.

## Next Steps for the Next Agent

1. Implement the dice material framework and effects (Phase 4a/4b).
2. Complete any remaining consumable effects (see above).
3. Continue with integration, polish, and balance as needed.

Good luck! The codebase is in great shape for the next phase.
