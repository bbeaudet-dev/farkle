# Problem Solving & Clarification Strategy

## General Approach

1. **Understand the Problem**

   - Read the relevant spec(s) and code.
   - Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear.

2. **Check for Existing Solutions**

   - Search the codebase for similar features or patterns.
   - Reuse or adapt existing code when possible.

3. **Draft a Plan**

   - Outline steps before coding.
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller parts.

4. **Implement Incrementally**

   - Make small, testable changes.
   - Commit frequently with clear messages.

5. **Test Thoroughly**

   - Add/expand tests for new or changed code.
   - Check for edge cases.

6. **Document Decisions**
   - Update specs/docs as needed.
   - Record major decisions in the handoff doc or commit messages.

## Clarification Checklist

- What is the desired outcome?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the edge cases?
- What is out of scope?
- Who is the user?
- What are the success criteria?

## When to Ask for Help

- When requirements are unclear or conflicting.
- When you’re blocked for more than 30 minutes.
- When you’re unsure about the impact of a change.
