## Transitioning to new chat/agent when previous chat gets too long

---

**Welcome to the next phase of this project!**

You have the previous agent’s handoff document and the past chat for context. The `docs/` folder contains valuable resources: past specifications, spec templates, troubleshooting guides, and principles/themes for this game.

**Please:**

- Ask clarifying questions whenever you’re uncertain—avoid guesswork and rework.
- Prioritize understanding and extending existing systems over creating new ones.
- Use and update specifications as you work.
- Document major decisions and changes for future agents.
- Commit changes incrementally with clear messages.

**Best Practices:**

- Use specifications and draw on previous code and solved problems whenever possible, rather than defaulting to adding new things.
- Reference the spec template in `docs/specs/spec-template.md` for new features or changes.
- Use the troubleshooting and problem-solving guides in `docs/` if you get stuck.
- If you’re unsure about anything, ask! We want to avoid guesswork, rework, and repetition as much as possible.

Good luck, and have fun!
