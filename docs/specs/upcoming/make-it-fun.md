Introduce "upgrades" to each charm.
Upgrades improve effect of charms.
Multipliers start at 1x and go up 0.05x for each level? 
Even more static ones like shortcut could eventually give a shortcut of 2 at say level 20

This overall is aimed at providing a more fun game loop, i.e. the player gets to upgrade one or more charms after each round? 
Maybe how many and which upgrades depends on how many points you banked, or if you flopped?
