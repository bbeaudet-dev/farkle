# Shop & Roguelike Progression System

## Overview

This spec defines the complete shop and roguelike progression system for Rollio. The game is now structured as a "run" of levels, where each level has a point threshold to reach within a limited number of rounds. Between levels, players visit shops to upgrade their capabilities for the next challenge.

## Core Concepts

### Game Structure Redefinition

- **Level**: A single challenge with rounds, threshold, and win/lose conditions
- **Run**: A complete game consisting of multiple levels until failure
- **Game**: The entire Rollio experience (multiple runs, meta-progression)

### Level System

Each level has:

- **Point Threshold**: Target score to advance
- **Round Limit**: Maximum rounds to achieve threshold
- **Difficulty Modifiers**: Scaling challenges and penalties
- **Rewards**: Money and items for completing the level

### Shop System

Between levels, players visit shops to:

- Buy charms, consumables, and dice upgrades
- Sell items for money
- Prepare for the next level's challenges

## Level Progression

### Level Structure

| Level | Rounds | Point Threshold | Difficulty | Shop Features                   |
| ----- | ------ | --------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1     | 8      | 3000            | Tutorial   | Basic items, low prices         |
| 2     | 7      | 5000            | Easy       | More variety, moderate prices   |
| 3     | 6      | 8000            | Medium     | Advanced items, higher prices   |
| 4     | 6      | 12000           | Hard       | Rare items, expensive           |
| 5     | 5      | 18000           | Expert     | Legendary items, very expensive |
| 6+    | 5      | +6000/level     | Boss       | Boss mechanics, special items   |

### Difficulty Scaling

**Point Thresholds**: Increase exponentially (3000 → 5000 → 8000 → 12000 → 18000 → 24000...)
**Round Limits**: Decrease over time (8 → 7 → 6 → 6 → 5 → 5...)
**Shop Prices**: Scale with level (base price × level multiplier)
**Flop Penalties**: Increase with level (more severe consequences)

### Level Completion

**Success**: Reach threshold within round limit

- Advance to next level
- Receive money reward (base + bonus for rounds remaining)
- Visit shop
- Carry over charms, consumables, and money

**Failure**: Don't reach threshold in time

- Game over (run ends)
- Display final statistics
- Option to start new run

### Pricing Logic

- **Base Prices**: Determined by item rarity

### Shop Mechanics

## Implementation Requirements

### Game State Updates

```typescript
interface GameState {
  // Level system
  currentLevel: number;
  roundsInLevel: number;
  maxRoundsInLevel: number;
  levelThreshold: number;

  // Shop system
  money: number;
  charms: Charm[];
  consumables: Consumable[];
  charmSlots: number;
  consumableSlots: number;

  // Progression
  levelsCompleted: number;
  totalMoneyEarned: number;
  runStatistics: RunStats;
}
```

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Level Transitions**: Clear progression between levels
- **Shop Interface**: Easy buying/selling with clear pricing
- **Inventory Display**: Show owned items and slots
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of level progress
- **Statistics**: Run and meta-progression tracking

### Technical Components

- **LevelManager**: Handles level progression and thresholds
- **ShopManager**: Manages shop inventory and transactions
- **InventoryManager**: Handles item storage and slots
- **ProgressionTracker**: Records statistics and meta-progression

## Combination Discovery System

### Balatro-Style Discovery

- Players cannot see certain advanced combinations until they have played them
- **Hidden combinations**: `sevenOfAKind`, `godStraight`, `fourPairs`, `tripleTriplets`
- **Always visible**: `singleFive`, `singleOne`, `threeOfAKind`, `fourOfAKind`, `fiveOfAKind`, `sixOfAKind`, `twoTriplets`, `straight`, `threePairs`

### Implementation Notes

- Add discovery tracking to game state
- Update combinations display command to show discovery status
- Sort combinations by points (lowest to highest)
- Show progress indicator (e.g., "8/13 combinations discovered")
- Use ✅ for discovered, ❓ for undiscovered combinations
- Display "???" for undiscovered combination names and points

### Technical Requirements

- Helper methods: `getAllPossibleCombinationTypes()`, `isCombinationDiscovered()`, `getDiscoveredCombinationsCount()`
- Integration with existing `combinationCounters` in game state
- Update `formatCombinationsDisplay()` in `CLIDisplayFormatter`
